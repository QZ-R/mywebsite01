Qing-Zeng Zhu is a Postdoc of organic geochemistry at the [Hinrichslab](https://www.marum.de/en/about-us/HinrichsLab-Home.html). His research interests include stable isotope probing (SIP), organic matter (OM) fate in marine sediments, and geomicrobiology. He is currently working on a project about secondary production and its role in reshaping the OM pool after the deposition from primary production in the ocean.
