<p>DARCLIFE (Deep subsurface Archaea: carbon cycle, life strategies, and role in sedimentary ecosystems) aims to <strong>study benthic archaea, their carbon cycle and life strategies in the deep subseafloor</strong>. It is a fruitful project which involves an interdisciplinary team of scientists from the fields of biogeochemistry, earth sciences, and microbiology. DARCLIFE started in April 2010 and is funded for five years through an Advanced Grant of the European Research Council. Even though it was finished 5 years ago, new finding benefited from this project has been continuing until today. I joined the project when I enrolled as a PhD student end of 2015.</p>
