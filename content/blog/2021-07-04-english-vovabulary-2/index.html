<p>Why brains and talent don’t bring success? How can they stand in the way of it? (挡住去路，阻碍) Why praising brains and talent doesn’t foster self-esteem and accomplishment, but jeopardizes them? How teaching a simple idea about the brain raises grades and productivity? Mindset is a simple idea discovered by world-renowned Stanford University psychologist Carol Dweck in decades of research on achievement and success—a simple idea that makes all the difference. In a fixed mindset, people believe their basic qualities, like their intelligence or talent, are simply fixed traits. They spend their time documenting their intelligence or talent instead of developing them. They also believe that talent alone creates success—without effort. They’re wrong. In a growth mindset, people believe that their most basic abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work—brains and talent are just the starting point. This view creates a love of learning and a resilience that is essential for great accomplishment. Virtually all great people have had these qualities. Teaching a growth mindset creates motivation and productivity in the worlds of business, education, and sports. It enhances relationships. When you read Mindset, you’ll see how.</p>

<p>Of a nation, of the world. (民族的就是世界的)</p>
