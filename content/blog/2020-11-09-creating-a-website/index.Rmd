This is my first time to create a website with the help of package blogdown and Hugo. It was not as hard as I have imagined in the beginning, but as time going on, I found it necessary to know a little bit about all the underlying technologies like the Hugo templating language, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I will keep updating if I am making a progress and keep in touch.
