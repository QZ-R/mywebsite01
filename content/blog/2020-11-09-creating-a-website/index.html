<p>This is my first time to create a website with the help of R package <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">blogdown</a> and <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>. It was not as hard as I have imagined in the beginning, but as time going on, I found it necessary to know a little bit about all the underlying technologies like HTML, CSS, Hugo templating language, and JavaScript. I will keep updating if I am making a progress and keep in touch!</p>
