[Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) is a revolutionary package. I started from learning base R by taking some courses in Uni two years ago. However, the more I learned, the more I felt confused because there were always two solutions to one R question in stack overflow. Since then I realized the existence of tidyverse, especially from dplyr, and gradually switched to be a tidyverse person.

This is the tidyverse family:

Here is the tidyverse learning material from [Dr. Olivier Gimenez](https://oliviergimenez.github.io/):

`r htmltools::HTML("{{< tweet 1319338464983289856 >}}")`

Here is the check and to-do list of my R (keep on updating):

- [x] tibble
- [x] readr
- [x] dplyr
- [x] tidyr
- [x] forcats
- [x] ggplot2 <br> 

tip.1 use regular expression either on axis or legends if sub/superscript, Greek letters needed;
```{r message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(scales)
ylab(expression(delta^{13}*"C"[CO2]))
scale_color_manual(name = "",
                   values = c("#ff6600", "#00b33c"),
                   labels = c(expression(with ^{13}*"C lipids"), expression(without ^{13}*"C lipids")))
```


- [ ] stringr
- [ ] purrr

- [x] readxl
- [ ] lubricate
- [ ] glue

[Tidymodels](https://www.tidymodels.org/) is definitely my next package to learn after all the packages above are checked.

By the way, I create this website not only to show my information in academics, but also want to share some insights or knowledge I have acquired, for example, [creating a website for free](../creating-a-website/).
