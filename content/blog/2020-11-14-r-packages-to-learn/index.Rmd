[tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) is a somehow for me a revolutionary package. I started from learning base R by taking some courses in Uni. However, the more I learned, the more I felt confused because there were always two solutions to one R question in stack overflow. Since then I realized the existence of tidyverse, especially from dplyr, and decided without hesitation switching totally to be a tidyverse person

This is the tidyverse family:

Here is the learning material from Olivier Gimenez:

`r htmltools::HTML("{{< tweet 1319338464983289856 >}}")`

Here is the check and todo list of my R journey (keep on updating):

- [x] tibble
- [x] readr
- [x] dplyr
- [x] tidyr
- [x] forcats
- [x] ggplot2
- [ ] stringr
- [ ] purrr

- [x] readxl
- [ ] lubricate
- [ ] glue

[tidymodels](https://www.tidymodels.org/) is definitely my next package to learn after all the packages above are checked.
